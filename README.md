A comprehensive statistical analysis project comparing two marketing channels (Channel A vs Channel B) using A/B testing methodology, hypothesis testing, and data visualization to drive data-driven budget allocation decisions.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project analyzes simulated marketing campaign data across two channels to determine which channel delivers better conversion rates and cost efficiency. The analysis uses statistical hypothesis testing to validate whether observed performance differences are statistically significant or due to random chance.

BUSINESS PROBLEM
Marketing teams need to optimize budget allocation across multiple advertising channels. This project answers:
Which channel has a higher conversion rate?
Is the difference statistically significant or just random variation?
Which channel is more cost-effective (lower CPA)?
How should budget be allocated based on data?
